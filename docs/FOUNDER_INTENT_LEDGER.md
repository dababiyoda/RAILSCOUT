# Founder Intent Ledger

Scope: Lawful Market Infrastructure Builder, RailScout/UNIIMENTE egregore continuity, and GitHub governance update.
Captured from: ChatGPT project conversation through 2026-08-19 21:51 America/New_York.
Repository: `dababiyoda/RAILSCOUT`.
Operational workspace: Notion page/database system named `Lawful Market Infrastructure Builder`.

This ledger preserves material founder intent. It separates active requirements from aspiration, inference, and unresolved claims. It does not grant the system authority to expand itself, spend money, contact external parties, handle confidential data, or bypass human authorization.

## Lifecycle states

Allowed states:

- `active`
- `implemented`
- `deferred`
- `superseded`
- `prohibited`
- `exploratory`
- `conflicted`
- `needs_evidence`

## Authority levels

- `constitutional_invariant`: fixed boundary unless Alfonso explicitly amends it.
- `active_requirement`: authorized operating rule for future agents.
- `proposal`: useful candidate, not executable without validation or approval.
- `aspiration`: directional intent, not operational authority.
- `unresolved_claim`: must be verified before use.

## Material intent records

| ID | Faithful statement | Lifecycle | Authority | Affected systems | Consequence class | Evidence / lineage | Review trigger |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| FI-20260819-001 | The existing Notion workspace `Lawful Market Infrastructure Builder` is the live operational source of truth. | active | active_requirement | Notion, agent runs, GitHub docs | standard | User explicitly instructed operator not to create a new workspace and to preserve continuity. | Any future Notion write or duplicate asset risk. |
| FI-20260819-002 | Future operators must search, fetch, inspect, and extend existing Notion assets before creating anything. | active | active_requirement | Notion | standard | User listed mandatory pre-creation steps. | Any create action in Notion. |
| FI-20260819-003 | Do not create duplicates, overwrite child pages, delete records, or treat old assets as disposable without explicit approval. | active | constitutional_invariant | Notion, governance | constitutional | User gave explicit preservation rule. | Any destructive or duplicate-prone action. |
| FI-20260819-004 | RailScout is an AI Research Refinery that helps build lawful market-infrastructure businesses rather than generic SaaS. | active | active_requirement | Strategy, research, validation | standard | User defined mission around eligibility, proof, routing, liability, settlement, compliance, governance, financing, procurement, and trust. | Any product-roadmap decision. |
| FI-20260819-005 | Competitive advantage must come from superior utility, governance, verified data, integration, risk reduction, capital efficiency, trust, and legitimate network effects. | active | constitutional_invariant | Strategy, legal/compliance | constitutional | User prohibited coercion, deception, unlawful monopoly conduct, collusion, sabotage, fraudulent claims, misuse of data, and unlawful competitor harm. | Any moat or go-to-market proposal. |
| FI-20260819-006 | Every factual claim must be tied to evidence; unsupported assumptions must not be treated as facts. | active | active_requirement | Evidence Library, Assumption Ledger | standard | User required evidence rows, counterevidence, confidence labels, and known/inferred/uncertain separation. | Any research or recommendation. |
| FI-20260819-007 | Strategy work must route into the correct Notion asset: evidence, assumptions, validation tests, stakeholders, market candidates, decisions, research tasks, and run logs. | active | active_requirement | Notion databases | standard | User specified database routing. | Any agent run output. |
| FI-20260819-008 | Manual validation precedes software. Start with standard, proof artifacts, stakeholder incentives, validation, governance, and a workflow where verified proof changes an economic outcome. | active | active_requirement | Product, GTM, validation | standard | User stated strategic design rules. | Any prototype or build recommendation. |
| FI-20260819-009 | Every action must move the Active Single Bottleneck Metric or unblock it. | active | active_requirement | Execution, KPI Dashboard | standard | User made ASBM central to all work. | Any roadmap, sprint, or next action. |
| FI-20260819-010 | Chat output after Notion work must be compact: inspected asset, updated/created asset, location, blocker, and next highest-leverage action. | active | active_requirement | Assistant output | lightweight | User gave explicit output rule. | Any Notion operation completion. |
| FI-20260819-011 | The workspace should run cumulatively and preserve continuity notes so future agents can recover context. | active | active_requirement | Run Logs, Decision Log, GitHub docs | standard | User requested continuity and cumulativeness. | Every run log update. |
| FI-20260819-012 | The desired automation cadence is hourly, but prior scheduling status was unresolved. | needs_evidence | unresolved_claim | Automations, Notion runs | standard | Prior assistant reported scheduler approval/auth timeout and requested retry. | Before assuming an hourly run is active. |
| FI-20260819-013 | GitHub should be updated with the conversation context and the recursive founder-intent protocol should be installed for the egregore. | implemented | active_requirement | GitHub docs | standard | User explicitly requested GitHub update and protocol update. | Before merge or future protocol expansion. |
| FI-20260819-014 | The correct repository for this update is `dababiyoda/RAILSCOUT`, not `dababiyoda/DALEOBANKS`. | implemented | active_requirement | GitHub repository targeting | standard | User corrected the target repository: "It’s in my railscout repository." | Any future GitHub work for RailScout doctrine. |
| FI-20260819-015 | Runtime autonomy must remain bounded by human authorization and existing safety gates wherever RailScout interfaces with autonomous agents. | active | constitutional_invariant | RailScout, UNIIMENTE, future agents | constitutional | User repeatedly requires lawful, ethical, auditable, human-authorized systems. | Any runtime behavior, external posting, self-modification, or money/contact action. |

## Conflict matrix

| Tension | Resolution | State |
|---|---|---|
| Notion is the live source of truth; GitHub is being updated too. | GitHub is a durable governance mirror and recovery spec. Notion remains operational command center. | resolved |
| User requested broad population/work output; duplication is prohibited. | Operators must inspect existing assets and extend them, not recreate them. | resolved |
| Hourly run was requested; scheduler status is unclear. | Preserve as desired cadence and unresolved operational claim until automation status is verified. | needs_evidence |
| Market-infrastructure ambition could drift into unlawful control language. | Keep legal/ethical commercial framing: trusted standard, verified proof, risk reduction, stakeholder adoption, interoperability, due process. | resolved |
| Agent autonomy could expand beyond founder intent. | Recursive protocol keeps human authorization final and requires explicit founder decision for material authority changes. | resolved |
| GitHub update was initially placed in DALEOBANKS. | DALEOBANKS PR was closed unmerged. Correct update was moved to RAILSCOUT. | resolved |

## Material decision MD-20260819-001

Decision question: Should the Lawful Market Infrastructure Builder conversation be installed into the RAILSCOUT repository as reversible governance documentation?

### Roles

- Founder-Intent Steward: preserve Alfonso's exact operating intent and prevent flattening it into generic startup language.
- Systems Architect: install the doctrine where future agents can recover it without changing runtime behavior.
- Adversarial Reviewer: prevent documentation sprawl, false authority, and confusion between Notion and GitHub.
- Operator and Maintainer: keep the change reviewable, small, branch-based, and easy to roll back.
- Evidence and Welfare Guardian: preserve lawful, auditable, non-coercive commercial boundaries.

### Pass 1: build upward

Advantages:

- RailScout gains a durable canonical governance spine.
- Future agents can recover the exact Notion non-duplication and routing rules.
- The update reduces drift between RailScout/UNIIMENTE intent and implementation.
- Documentation can clarify lawful market-infrastructure language and prevent unsafe aggressive framing.

Disadvantages converted into design constraints:

- Risk: GitHub docs could be mistaken for the live source of truth. Constraint: explicitly state Notion remains operational source of truth.
- Risk: docs could become bureaucracy. Constraint: create only the minimum needed documents and link them from README.
- Risk: broad founder intent could become over-authorized. Constraint: mark lifecycle state and authority level for every material intent.
- Risk: wrong repository targeting could repeat. Constraint: record `dababiyoda/RAILSCOUT` as the correct repository and the DALEOBANKS PR as superseded.

Alternatives considered:

- Do nothing: preserves repo cleanliness but loses conversation continuity.
- Dump raw conversation: preserves volume but damages usability.
- Put RailScout doctrine in DALEOBANKS: wrong repository and cross-organ confusion.
- Branch-based RailScout governance docs: highest reversibility with adequate preservation.

### Pass 2: stress and strengthen

Attack:

- A new ledger can still become stale if operators do not update it.
- The Notion workspace cannot be verified from GitHub alone.
- A broad doctrine can encourage agents to produce strategy theater instead of validation work.
- RailScout is currently sparse, so over-documentation could outpace implementation.

Strengthened design:

- Mark the Notion state as reported, not independently verified.
- Put the ASBM discipline and exact Notion routing rules in the operating spec.
- Keep the update documentation-only and branch-based.
- Preserve open blockers, especially hourly automation status.
- Require every major recommendation to include claim, evidence, assumption, risk, counterexample, validation test, legal review needed, and next action.

Decision: `EXPERIMENT`

Rationale: install the governance update on a dedicated RailScout branch and draft pull request so Alfonso can inspect before merge. No runtime code, credentials, scheduler behavior, or external effects are changed.

Rollback: close the pull request or delete the branch. No migration or data deletion is required.

Residual risks:

- Future agents may forget to update this ledger after Notion changes.
- The hourly automation may remain unconfigured unless separately verified.
- Notion state described here must be revalidated before operational reliance.

Review trigger:

- Any merge into `main`;
- any attempt to automate hourly runs;
- any runtime code change tied to this doctrine;
- any new business thesis selected as active.

## Items intentionally unchanged

- Runtime code remains unchanged.
- Notion content is not asserted as verified by this GitHub update.
- No external outreach, payment, filing, or legal representation is authorized by this ledger.
- DALEOBANKS PR #72 was closed unmerged and remains superseded by this RailScout update.
