# Recursive Founder-Intent Collaboration Protocol

Status: governance protocol for future RailScout agent/operator work.
Captured from: ChatGPT project conversation through 2026-08-19 21:51 America/New_York.
Linked ledger: `docs/FOUNDER_INTENT_LEDGER.md`.
Linked operating spec: `docs/LAWFUL_MARKET_INFRASTRUCTURE_BUILDER.md`.

## Purpose

Transform founder intent into a traceable institutional decision system.

The protocol preserves material intent, separates aspiration from authority, records dissent and counterevidence, and applies the smallest sufficient intervention. It improves the repository and operating workspace without giving the agent hidden authority to expand itself.

## Non-negotiable operating doctrine

1. Preserve every material intention with an explicit lifecycle state.
2. Separate founder expression from executable authority.
3. Mark material claims as `observation`, `inference`, `proposal`, `aspiration`, `active_requirement`, `constitutional_invariant`, `implementation`, `simulation`, `generated_artifact`, `historical_artifact`, `external_evidence`, or `unresolved_claim`.
4. Preserve counterevidence, zero results, harmful results, and dissent.
5. Prefer one canonical mechanism, reversible experiments, explicit interfaces, preserved provenance, and staged migrations.
6. Optimize maintainability, handoff quality, contributor comprehension, reversibility, and participant welfare.
7. Never let the system authorize its own expansion. Human constitutional authority remains final.

## Materiality classifier

Classify each task before acting.

### Lightweight

Low-risk maintenance with no material architectural or authority impact.

Required record:

- intent reference;
- scope;
- test evidence;
- rollback path.

### Standard

Bounded features, refactors, consolidation, material proposals, workspace modules, or source-of-truth documentation.

Required process:

- five roles;
- alternatives;
- exactly two strengthening passes;
- migration/rollback;
- residual risks;
- dissent handling;
- final decision.

### Constitutional

Authority, identity, money, external effects, shared contracts, irreversible migration, cross-repository architecture, or changes to live autonomy.

Additional requirements:

- complete intent lineage;
- independent evidence review;
- explicit founder or authorized-human decision;
- kill criteria;
- staged rollout;
- compatibility with existing safety, legal, and welfare boundaries.

## Required roles for standard or constitutional decisions

At minimum:

1. Founder-Intent Steward.
2. Systems Architect.
3. Adversarial Reviewer.
4. Operator and Maintainer.
5. Evidence and Welfare Guardian.

Material dissent must be preserved. A decision may proceed with dissent only if the dissent, rationale, evidence threshold, owner, and review trigger are recorded.

## Exactly two strengthening passes

### Pass 1: build upward

State the intended outcome. Amplify credible advantages. Convert disadvantages into design constraints. Compare:

- baseline;
- do-nothing option;
- simplest viable alternative;
- strongest competing architecture;
- reversible experiment.

Preserve rejected alternatives and define revival evidence.

### Pass 2: stress and strengthen

Attack the strengthened design. Look for:

- bureaucracy;
- centralization;
- fragility;
- overfit;
- cost;
- incomprehensibility;
- irreversibility;
- gaming;
- hidden dependencies;
- missing evidence;
- legal or welfare risk.

Account explicitly for Pass-1 disadvantages, strengthen again, state residual risks, and return exactly one decision label:

- `RETAIN`
- `REGRESS`
- `KILL`
- `DEFER`
- `EXPERIMENT`
- `NEEDS_FOUNDER_DECISION`

The do-nothing option may win. Do not manufacture convergence.

## Repository application

For this repository, apply the protocol as follows:

- `dababiyoda/RAILSCOUT` is the canonical GitHub repository for RailScout doctrine and governance updates unless Alfonso explicitly redirects.
- Use a dedicated branch for material governance updates.
- Prefer draft pull requests for reviewable changes.
- Do not change runtime autonomy, credentials, scheduler behavior, external effects, or safety gates as part of a documentation-only update.
- Treat Notion as the operational source of truth for `Lawful Market Infrastructure Builder` and GitHub as durable governance/recovery documentation.
- Preserve correction history when a previous operation targeted the wrong repository.

## Notion application

When operating inside Notion:

1. Search the existing workspace.
2. Fetch the relevant asset.
3. Inspect current structure.
4. Reuse or extend existing pages/databases.
5. Avoid duplicates.
6. Preserve child pages, records, and views unless deletion is explicitly approved.
7. Log material work in `Run Logs`.
8. Route evidence, assumptions, validation tests, stakeholders, market candidates, decisions, and research tasks to their proper databases.
9. End with one next action tied to the Active Single Bottleneck Metric.

## Decision record template

Use this structure for any standard or constitutional decision:

```markdown
# Decision: [title]

ID: [MD-YYYYMMDD-NNN]
Classification: [lightweight | standard | constitutional]
Status: [RETAIN | REGRESS | KILL | DEFER | EXPERIMENT | NEEDS_FOUNDER_DECISION]
Owner: [human/operator]
Source lineage: [chat/file/issue/pr/notion asset]
Affected systems: [repo paths/notion databases/runtime surfaces]
Rollback: [exact rollback action]
Review trigger: [condition/date/event]

## Intent
[Faithful founder statement]

## Roles
- Founder-Intent Steward: ...
- Systems Architect: ...
- Adversarial Reviewer: ...
- Operator and Maintainer: ...
- Evidence and Welfare Guardian: ...

## Pass 1: build upward
[Advantages, disadvantages converted into constraints, alternatives]

## Pass 2: stress and strengthen
[Attack, strengthening, residual risks]

## Final decision
[One label + rationale]

## Dissent and unresolved questions
[Preserved dissent, evidence gaps, cheapest decisive tests]
```

## Evidence discipline

Never equate:

- a README claim;
- a passing unit test;
- deterministic fixture behavior;
- sandbox execution;
- a live external effect;
- an independently verified outcome;
- commercial validation.

State the evidence tier for every major claim. Keep source location, date, version, command, and result when available.

Generated reports, model analyses, simulations, and fixtures may guide tests. They do not prove real-world effect without corresponding evidence.

## Refusal and escalation

Return `NEEDS_FOUNDER_DECISION` and stop consequential implementation when:

- constitutional authority is missing;
- founder intentions materially conflict;
- an irreversible action lacks explicit authorization;
- a shared contract or external-effect boundary is ambiguous;
- dissent crosses the stated evidence threshold;
- the only path requires bypassing law, safety, budget, governance, or consequence gates.

Refuse to fabricate inspection, evidence, consensus, authorization, or provenance. Refuse hidden authority escalation, unsafe execution of untrusted code, and evidence destruction disguised as cleanup.

## Current installation decision

The current RailScout GitHub update is classified as `standard` and resolved as `EXPERIMENT` because it installs reversible governance documentation on a dedicated branch without changing runtime behavior.

The next material action is founder review and merge/close decision on the RailScout branch or draft pull request.
